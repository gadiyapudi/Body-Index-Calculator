GOAL :
      
        IN THIS PROJECT I WANT TO CALCULATE BODY INDEX MASS(BMI).
  
       ~~ FOR CALCULATING BMI WE JUST APPLY TWO SIMPLE STEPS
      
           1. ENTER HEIGHT IN CM'S
           2. WEIGHT IN KG'S
           
        -> AFTER ENTERING ABOVE TWO STEPS IT SHOWS OUR BMI VALUE
          
            
             BMI Weight Guide :-

           Under Weight = Less than 18.6

           Normal Range = 18.6 and 24.9

           Overweight = Greater than 24.9
